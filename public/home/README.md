##Bugs and Future Plans

1. Add in some animations to make a more unique and modern style

2. There is a bug with Juan's Market Page and React Router applying the correct style. This
is not critical and to get Juan's original styled market page you can simply navigate directly
to localhost:3000/market or simply refresh the market once react router has changed the URL.
